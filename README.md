# Cosmos Framework
A frontend framework for creating reactive UIs using direct DOM manipulation. (Heavily WIP)

## How to get started with Cosmos Framework
(Coming soon) Download via NPM:
```
npm i cosmos-framework
```

(For now) Download via NPM, but not via the registry:
```
npm i https://github.com/CosmicMedia/Cosmos-Framework
```

To get started easier, you can [look at our demo](https://github.com/BlakeB415/Cosmos-Framework-Demo) and we'll put real documentation here when we're out of the alpha stage of development.
